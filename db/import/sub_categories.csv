In the first part of the class, we will hunt through my garden identifying weeds, especially the tasty edible ones, and learn which vegetables can usefully be left to go feral. I will share my experience on how to control weeds with a range of techniques suitable for all types of gardens and situations.

For the second part, we will have a practical weeding session. We will clear a badly overgrown garden bed which is seriously in need of weeding, using it to understand the strategies that different weeds use - and how to outsmart them. There&#039;s no charge for this class, but you will be providing a bit of practical assistance with my garden.
