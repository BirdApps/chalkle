Hello #{@chalkler.name.split[0]},

Here is your daily digest for today #{Date.today()}

- if !( @new_interesting_lessons = @new_lessons.find(:all, :conditions => ["category_id IN (?)", @chalkler.email_categories] ) ).nil?
  New classes in the last 24 hours:
  = render partial: "chalkler_interest_mailer/digest_lesson_table", locals: { interesting_lessons: @new_interesting_lessons }

Thank you for supporting chalkle and we look forward to seeing you soon!
