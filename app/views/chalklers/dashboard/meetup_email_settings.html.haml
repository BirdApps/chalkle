        &#9632; You will be directed to a page with 
        a list of emails that Meetup sends.

        &#9632; Due to the large volume of emails, 
        we recommend you uncheck every 
        box except for the boxes “changes 
        to the Meetup I am attending”, “a 
        confirmation that I’ve RSVP’d for”, 
        “Don’t send me reminders” and 
        “Special announcements from 
        Organizers to members”. 
      %p
        &#9632; This way, 
        you will continue to receive 
        reminders for classes you signed 
        up for, but not advertisements for 
        new classes
