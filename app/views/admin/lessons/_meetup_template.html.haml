%b about chalkle&deg
%br
Chalkle&deg enables learning for communities in real life. Small affordable classes mean high value for participants, extracting the knowledge and skills otherwise hidden within the community. Chalkle&deg redefines what it means to be a teacher or a learner, helping everyone undertake training in practical, artistic or academic skills while fostering lifelong learning.
%br
%br
%b policy
%br
Chalkle&deg expects pre-payment for all classes. If you have not paid you will be placed on the waiting list to allow other chalklers to attend. You will be moved to attending once chalkle&deg has received confirmation of your payment.
%br
If you RSVP for a class and fail to show up, you will get a "no show". Three no shows means you will be removed from chalkle&deg. You may request to rejoin after six months.
%br
If you cancel your RSVP:
%br
\- less than 3 days before = no refund
%br
\- after 7pm the night before = no refund and a "no show" will be recorded 
%br
%br
%b disclaimer

Whilst every possible assistance will be offered, chalkle&deg, teachers and members cannot be held responsible for any accident, injuries or losses sustained leading up to, during, or after a class.
