          Silvia Zuur and Linc Gasking started chalkle over a cup of coffee in mid 2012. A whirlwind of community organising followed and Chalkle classes exploded in Wellington, with Silvia organising over 600 classes in 12 months to serve a world where ‘anyone could teach and anyone could learn’.

          Demand grew, the business evolved, technology was built. Now, with the same spirit of ‘anyone can...’ chalkle.com aims to give anyone who wants to start a learning business, everything they need to succeed.
