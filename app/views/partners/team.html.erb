      <h2>Chalkle’s Backstory</h2>

      <p>
        Chalkle started over a cup of coffee between Silvia Zuur and Linc Gasking in mid 2012. A whirlwind of community organising followed, and Chalkle exploded in Wellington, with Silvia organising over 600 classes in 12 months to serve a world where ‘anyone could teach and anyone could learn’.
      </p>
      <p>
        Demand grew, the business evolved, technology was built. Now, with the same spirit of ‘anyone can...’ Chalkle is supporting educators with software tools and a marketing platform.

      <h1>A business engine, fuelled by social impact</h1>

      <p>
        A Social Enterprise uses business tools to deliver social impact. When we call Chalkle a Social Enterprise, this is what we mean:
      </p>


      <h2>Of Service</h2>
      <p>
        Technology is already changing what is possible in education, from primary schools and universities, to the grassroots of adult community learning. Our focus is to serve the reignition of adult learning opportunities, from the community level up.
      </p>
      <h2>Learning for anyone</h2>
      <p>
        We refuse to allow cost to be barrier to those who fit our values, see our vision and want to share their skills with the world. Our cost structure is designed for accessibility. We want to enable everyone – from independent teachers, volunteer community groups up to large organisations and businesses – to deliver great learning opportunities in our communities.
      </p>
      <h2>Partners first</h2>
      <p>
        Our business model is designed as a platform for our organisational partners. Chalkle thrives only when our partners and teachers thrive – that is why we call them partners, not customers.
      </p>
      <h2>Go far together</h2>
      <p>
        Joining Chalkle means joining an active network of collaborators. Chalkle works by catalysing and strengthening local learning eco-systems – not replacing them.
