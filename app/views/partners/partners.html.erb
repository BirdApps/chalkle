    <h1 class="grid-100">FAQs</h1>

    <div class="grid-45 suffix-10">
      <strong>How does the class price work?</strong>
        <p>
          The price of classes is completely flexible, determined by the channel partner and teacher. Chalkle calculates an advertised price per chalkler for each class based on:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="left-hand-equation white">
            teacher fee + channel admin fee + chalkle success fee
          </span> <br /> x 
          <span class="right-hand-equation">
            a transaction processing fee of 2.75%
          </span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid-45 ">
      <strong>What are the success fees?</strong>
        <p>
          The success fee is a fixed chalkle fee of $2 (+GST) per chalkler, per class. This fee is automatically added to the advertised price of a class and deducted before delivering payments to channel organisations. This is our way of remaining agnostic and providing equal value to all our customers, from independent teachers and volunteer community groups to larger enterprises.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="clear"></div>


    <div class="grid-45 suffix-10">
      <strong>Teacher fee</strong>
        <p>
          For each class teachers are asked to calculate a cost per chalkler (how much would they like to earn, per person in the class).
        </p>
    </div>




    <div class="grid-45">
      <strong>Payments</strong>
        <p>
          Classes are pre-paid by chalklers when they sign up to a class online. Chalkle collects all payments from classes and makes payments to teachers and channel organizations monthly.
        </p>
