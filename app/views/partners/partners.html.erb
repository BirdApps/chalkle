    <h1 class="grid-100">FAQs</h1>

    <div class="grid-50">
      <strong>How does the class price work?</strong>
        <p>
          The price of classes is completely flexible, determined by the channel partner and teacher. Chalkle° calculates an advertised price per chalkler for each class based on:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="left-hand-equation">
            teacher fee + channel admin fee + chalkle success fee
          </span> x 
          <span class="right-hand-equation">
            credit card %
          </span>
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="grid-50">
      <strong>What are the success fees?</strong>
        <p>
          The success fee is a fixed chalkle° fee of $2 (+GST) per chalkler, per class. This fee is automatically added to the advertised price of a class and deducted before delivering payments to channel organisations. This is our way of remaining agnostic and providing equal value to all our customers, from independent teachers and volunteer community groups to larger enterprises.

    <div class="grid-50">
      <strong>Teacher fee</strong>
        <p>
          For each class teachers are asked to calculate a cost per chalkler (how much would they like to earn, per person in the class).
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="grid-50">
      <strong>Channel fee</strong>
        <p>
          The channel fee is a price per chalkler that is designed to covering some of the costs of administering a chalkle° channel (relevant when a channel is managing multiple teachers). It is up to each channel organisation to set this fee. The channel fee is defaulted to $2 per chalkler per class, but it can be zero or any other amount.
        </p>
    </div>



    <div class="grid-50">
      <strong>Payments</strong>
        <p>
          Classes are pre-paid by chalklers when they sign up to a class online. Chalkle° collects all payments from classes and makes payments to teachers and channel organizations monthly.
