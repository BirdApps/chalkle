Welcome to chalkle°!

Thanks for joining chalkle°! Isn’t it exciting to see a community grow around a
wish to learn, teach and share skills from each other.

Your Channel Curator has created an account for you on my.chalkle.com
(http://my.chalkle.com).  You can use this to submit class details. To activate
your account simply create a password by clicking on the link below:

<%= "#{edit_chalkler_password_url}?initial=true&reset_password_token=#{@chalkler.reset_password_token}" %>

We hope to be able to help connect you with people who can share skills and
knowledge. If you have things you can teach then we can enable that to
happen. We can help you advertise (find great people), sort all the money
practicalities, help you find a location, and give suggestions on what makes
a great chalkle° class.

Do like us on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/chalkle) and follow us on
Twitter (https://twitter.com/ChalkleNZ).

As this is a new initiative, we are still experimenting and playing, so please
do get in touch if you have any feedback or ideas - in that way we can create
chalkle° to really meet your needs and those of the community.

Cheers,
The chalkle° team
