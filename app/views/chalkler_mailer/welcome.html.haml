  Welcome to chalkle&deg;!

%p{ style: paragraph_style }
  Thanks for joining chalkle&deg;! Isnâ€™t it exciting to see a community
  grow around a wish to learn, teach and share skills from each other.

%p{ style: paragraph_style }
  Your Channel Curator has created an account for you on
  = link_to 'my.chalkle.com', 'http://my.chalkle.com', { style: link_style }
  You can use this to submit class details. To activate your account simply
  create a password by clicking on the link below:

%p{ style: paragraph_style }
  != link_to 'Create account password', "#{edit_chalkler_password_url}?initial=true&reset_password_token=#{@chalkler.reset_password_token}", { style: link_style }

%p{ style: paragraph_style }
  We hope to be able to help connect you with people who can share skills and
  knowledge. If you have things you can teach then we can enable that to
  happen. We can help you advertise (find great people), sort all the money
  practicalities, help you find a location, and give suggestions on what makes
  a great chalkle&deg; class.
